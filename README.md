# Twitch "Go Live" Twitter Bot

A simple Twitter bot written in node.js that posts a tweet if a specific Twitch channel is live.

## Usage

To get started, clone this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.

Create your own `config.js` file in `src` folder following the example file `config.js.EXAMPLE`. Replace each configuration key's value accordingly.

:information_source: **Note:** A developer account is required on both Twitter and Twitch to get the necessary configuration values.

Once that is set up, just run `npm run start` when the Twitch channel is live. :tada:
